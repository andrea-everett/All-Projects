# all-projects
A small collection of projects to advance my Javascript skill set and knowledge.

JS tools I learned from these projects:
- how to use an image API to create a scroll that appears infinite
- how to create a dark/light mode
- how to use event listeners with audio to create a joke-teller
- how to use a quote API to generate a series of quotes "on-click"
- how to use event listeners to make a music player
- getElementById to create social icon pop-up
